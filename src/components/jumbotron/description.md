I am Ishan Deshpande, a senior pursuing a integrated master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **UT Austin**. My passion lies in embedded software development, particularly in control-related fields such as robotics or vehicle control, as well as consumer electronics. Currently, I am the Platform Lead on the UT Longhorn Racing Solar Team, where I work on ARM-based 
embedded systems and a real-time operating system (RTOS) for controlling a solar-powered vehicle.


During my last summer internship at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), I had the opportunity to work on Body Controls Firmware for their Electronic Control Units on a wide array of vehicles. Previously, I was an intern at [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/), pioneering advanced control systems for flight and navigation. In my free time, I like to listen to albums and produce music.
