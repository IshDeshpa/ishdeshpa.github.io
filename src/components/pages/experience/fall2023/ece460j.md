In Data Science Lab, I learned and applied data science basics such as regression, classification, decision trees, bagging and boosting. I also experimented with model tuning, performance, practical issues, and challenges. I participated in the class Kaggle competition and worked with a group on a final project to denoise and restore old images for the UT History department.
