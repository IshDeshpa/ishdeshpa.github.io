In Introduction to Stochastic Processes, I discussed generating functions and their utility in analyzing random processes, then random processes starting in the discrete-time domain (simple random walk, branching process & probability of extinction of branching process), then moving to the continuous time domain (continuous time Markov process, Poisson process, Brownian motion), and also analyzing rate matrices & generator matrices.
