In Digital Logic Design, I was introduced to Verilog for an FPGA on the design tool Xilinx Vivado. I worked with logic simulation, synthesis, and FPGA configuration. The course also covered Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential logic components, storage elements, timing and timing-related non-idealities (setup/hold constraints, hazards), finite state machines, datapath components, RTL design, and FSM optimization.
