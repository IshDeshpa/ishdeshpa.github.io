In Operating Systems, I worked with a group and wrote C for Stanfordâ€™s PintOS operating system through a series of projects designed to teach the basics of a kernel. This included running user programs, implementing virtual memory, and designing our own file system. We also designed a basic shell called YASH (Yet Another Shell).
