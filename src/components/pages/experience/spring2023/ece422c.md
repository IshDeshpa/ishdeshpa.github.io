In Software Design and Implementation II, I learned about object-oriented programming, the four pillars of OOP (encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance), design & implementation of Java programs, JavaFX usage, and some multithreading & network communication. I applied these skills through several projects and one final project.
