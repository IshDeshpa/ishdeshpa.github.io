In Stanford Onlineâ€™s Machine Learning course on Coursera, I learned a basic overview of several ML techniques including Supervised Learning (linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, SVMs), Unsupervised Learning (k-means clustering, PCA for dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection), Special ML Applications (recommender systems, large scale machine learning), and general advice on building a machine learning system (bias/variance, regularization, evaluation of learning algorithms, learning curves, error analysis, ceiling analysis).
