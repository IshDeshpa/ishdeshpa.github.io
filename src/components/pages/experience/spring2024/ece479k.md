Learned about programming language representation, common transformations, analyses, and optimizations, intermediate languages, and design choices in lecture and learned about the software engineering challenges of implementing a compiler and simple runtime support for an imperative, object-oriented language in programming labs. Used LLVM framework to create a front-end and back-end for "Classroom Object Oriented Language" (COOL).
