In Embedded Systems Design Lab, I took a more in-depth look at interfacing with a microcontroller from both a hardware and software perspective. This includes topics like board-level communication protocols (SPI, CAN, UART), data acquisition systems, PCB design in KiCAD, protocols for IoT Wi-Fi communication (TCP, UDP), and PID control. Our final project was a design competition with the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller, for which my group designed a functional GameBoy emulator that could parse GameBoy assembly and run an interactive game on a TFT LCD with functional audio & control. This involved QSPI communication between three microprocessors (a CPU, Audio Processing Unit, and Pixel Processing Unit) as well as 16-bit parallel communication with the TFT display and interfacing with a speaker. My lab group was awarded **third place** in the competition.
