professor: Dr. David Soloveichik

Learned about and exposed to new perspectives on computation: models of highly distributed and
unstructured computation such as that occurring in chemical reactions, models in which building is
equivalent to computing, models that address the ultimate limits of low energy computation, and models
that compute by relaxing to the lowest energy state. Topics included cellular automata, chemical reaction computing, analog computing, thermodynamic computing, reversible computing, and quantum computing.
