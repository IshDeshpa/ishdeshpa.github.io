In Circuit Theory, I learned about capacitance and inductance; first- and second-order transient circuit response, including operational amplifier circuits; sinusoidal steady state analysis; Bode plots; complex power in single and balanced three-phase systems; transformers; two-port networks (Z-parameters and Y-parameters); and computer-aided analysis and design.
