In Engineering Communication, I explored advanced engineering communication skills, with emphasis on technical documents, oral reports, and graphics. Several aspects of both technical and persuasive writing were covered. I also participated in collaborative work involving online communication and research. The final project for the course involved writing an IEEE style, full-length research paper detailing several legal and technical solutions to mitigate the spread of deepfake technologies.
