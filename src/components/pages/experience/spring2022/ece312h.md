In Software Design and Implementation I, I took an in-depth look at C and C++, exploring fundamental software engineering principles including the stack and the heap, memory allocation, pass by value/pointer/reference, algorithm complexity analysis (Big-O), sorting, recursion, and object-oriented programming. I also learned about basic data structures such as linked data structures, binary search trees, hash tables, and maps. Finally, I gained hands-on experience debugging and testing C/C++ code in a Linux environment through 8 different programming assignments involving concepts learned through lecture.
