In Introduction to Embedded Systems, I worked with assembly and C/C++ programming to cover many facets of embedded systems, including but not limited to: general-purpose I/O, interrupts and timers, debugging strategies, creating a DAC, reading an ADC, and serial communication through UART/SPI. Throughout the course we worked with the [Tiva Launchpad TM4C123G Evaluation Board](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL), an ARM Cortex-M4 based microcontroller, ARM Assembly Language, and C/C++. Our final project was a design competition for implementing a basic game on the board (for which you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5PAtDdpwP4) and view our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IshDeshpa/EE319H-Lab10-PvZ)). My lab group was awarded **first place** in the competition.
