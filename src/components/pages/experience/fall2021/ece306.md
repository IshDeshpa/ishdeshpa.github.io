In Introduction to Computing, I explored the fundamentals of computer engineering from the bottom-up: starting with transistors and simple boolean logic and working up to an implementation of memory and the Von Neumann Model of Computation. Then, I utilized a simplified and simulated version of a modern computer [Yale Pattâ€™s LC-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) to understand the basics of assembly language, subroutines, interrupts, and rudimentary applications.
