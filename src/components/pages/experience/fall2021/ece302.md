In Introduction to Electrical Engineering, I gained a basic understanding of analog circuit analysis. This includes concepts such as voltage, resistance, current and power, and their relation to one another. I also learned more advanced methods of analysis, including Nodal/Mesh analysis and Thevenin/Norton equivalent circuits. Finally, I studied the basics of operational amplifiers.
