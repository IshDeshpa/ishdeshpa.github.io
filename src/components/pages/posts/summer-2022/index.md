#### **EnergyX** Internship

This summer, I interned at [EnergyX](https://energyx.com/), a startup that produces lithium extraction equipment. I worked on the controls side of things, learning Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technology from the bottom up. A PLC is a microcontroller housed in a small box, made to run 24/7 in a factory environment and never fail. All it really does is give/receive commands based on programmed logic to/from corresponding I/O Cards, which you can think of like GPIO ports. These I/O Cards will connect to your physical components in the factory, whether they be sensors, fans, pumps, or valves. To program the PLCs used at EnergyX, I used the Rockwell Automation software Studio 5000, which allows you to create block code for each component on your machine. A companion software called FactoryTalk View allows you to design an HMI (Human Machine Interface) in order to allow an operator to control the process.

I've been told that most of the big plants use either Siemens or Rockwell Automation technology. These companies create low failure, high efficiency technology that costs hundreds, and license out software that costs thousands. It's interesting to see the standards of factory technology and how it compares to and deviates from typical embedded systems design and programming.

#### **Machine Learning Course**

Another point of interest this summer was my first steps into Machine Learning. I started taking Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng. If you look up [the course now](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) it will be updated to Python, as I was part of the last batch that signed up for the older version of the course. Still, it has been quite interesting to actually understand what ML actually is. I'm about three weeks away from the course's conclusion, and I've been learning about linear/logistic regression, neural networks, backpropagation, support vector machines, and unsupervised learning techniques. I hope to dive more into ML with the [Human Centered Robotics Laboratory](https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/), as I will be working with them this semester.

#### **Solar Car Competition in Topeka, KS**

I attended the Formula Sun Grand Prix at the beginning of July. You can read more about our solar car and the competition on [my previous post](https://ishdeshpa.com/the-longhorn-racing-solar-team-2021-22-retrospective/).

#### **Updating this website**

To make my website stand out a little more, and to add more customizable features, I've opted to slowly transition the website to GatsbyJS and React. I've never done React before so it's a bit challenging to work with components and JSX, but I hope to complete the transition by the end of December. It's a bit tough to work on it during the semester, but maybe I'll have more time during Thanksgiving and Winter Break. You can find the progress I've made so far [here](https://github.com/IshDeshpa/ishdeshpa-com).

#### **Relaxing a little**

Of course, not everything is work related. I've been making beats on FL Studio, watching movies and TV (I recommend _Better Call Saul_, _Severance_, and _The Bear_), and catching up with friends in Austin. I've also been listening to a lot of new music (the new Kendrick Lamar and Beyonce albums are personal favorites).

Thanks for taking the time to check out what I've been doing over the summer!
