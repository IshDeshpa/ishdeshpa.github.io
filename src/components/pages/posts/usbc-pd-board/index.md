Hello friends!
I've been working on a USB Type-C Power Delivery board for the past couple of months. I got tired of lugging a large adjustable 120V power supply back home that had a current limit of 1A. I wanted something that could be powered by a USB-C charger and could deliver up to 12V at 8.33A.
