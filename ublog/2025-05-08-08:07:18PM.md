Today i was pushing the start of my OSdev project and realized that the binutils-gdb and gcc submodules could not be submodules without using git LFS, so i had to delete them :(. I did an interactive rebase to squash all my commits into one so that git had no idea they ever existed (bc otherwise they would have been in the commit history and it would have still taken ages)
