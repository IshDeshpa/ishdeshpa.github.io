\begin{letter}{Hiring Team at Waymo}

\opening{Dear Hiring Team at Waymo,}
I am excited to apply for a position at Waymo, a leader in self-driving technology. As a senior in UT Austin's Integrated Masters program in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in embedded systems (graduating in 2026), I am eager to contribute to Waymo's mission of transforming transportation through autonomous solutions.

My expertise spans hardware and software, focusing on designing robust, real-time systems and leveraging machine learning. During my internship at Tesla as a Firmware Developer, I contributed to firmware development for vehicle systems, refining my ability to design and optimize embedded solutions for safety-critical environments. My time at Tesla deepened my understanding of autonomous vehicle systems and underscored the importance of innovation and reliabilityâ€”values that align with Waymo's mission.

Key highlights of my experience include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Custom Bootloader Development:} Designed a UART/CAN bootloader for STM32 microcontrollers in the UT Solar Car project, ensuring seamless firmware updates and reliable communication.
    \item \textbf{USB PD Power Supply Design:} Engineered a 100W power supply with isolated outputs suitable for CAN environments, demonstrating proficiency in designing robust hardware solutions for automotive applications.
    \item \textbf{Custom BSP Implementation:} Managed a team to develop a custom interrupt-based BSP built on STM32's HAL library integrated with FreeRTOS for the UT Solar Car project.
    \item \textbf{GameBoy Emulator Project:} Developed a functional emulator on three TM4C microcontrollers as part of my Embedded Systems Final Project, showcasing my creativity in integrating hardware and software.
\end{itemize}

Beyond technical development, my roles as a Teaching Assistant for Operating Systems and Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Systems and ML Research Group have honed my debugging, kernel-level development, and analytical problem-solving skills. These experiences complement my hands-on engineering expertise, preparing me to tackle the challenges Waymo faces in delivering safe and scalable autonomous systems.

The opportunity to work with a creative team responsible for the bring-up of new hardware platforms and building a multi-platform software stack is incredibly exciting. I am particularly drawn to the role of developing a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) as this is an area where my experience in embedded systems and firmware development can make a significant impact, and something I have three years of experience in through the solar car project and previous internships.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on a bleeding-edge project at the intersection of traditional robotics and modern ML techniques. Waymo's innovative approach to self-driving technology and commitment to pushing the boundaries of autonomous systems resonate deeply with my passion for advancing the field of robotics and perception.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Waymo's vision and would welcome the chance to discuss how my experiences align with your goals.
