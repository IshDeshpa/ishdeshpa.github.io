# Jobs
## Part 1: Hobby Engineering
In elementary and middle school, I participated in the Hour of Code, probably my first exposure to computer science/engineering in general. The narrative that was fed to everyone was that "coding will be an essential skill in the next 10-15 years, and you'd better learn it soon to get a head start." Parts of that were true.

In high school, I was part of FIRST Robotics. There, I was exposed to control algorithms and interfacing with hardware. The narrative that was fed to everyone was that "robotics is a blossoming career area, and you'd better get interested in it now to get a head start." Folks put it on their college resumes (even when they maybe shouldn't have). Of course, the reality is that probably 20% (if not less) of the members of the FIRST team would go into specifically robotics; the other 80% going into a broader field of engineering. Heck, I myself have ended up in embedded systems (although this goes quite hand-in-hand with robotics).

Now, in my last year-and-a-half of college, I'm part of the Solar Car team. Here, the name itself suggests that we work on sustainability and efficiency efforts. We don't; in fact, the waste we produce probably offsets the energy gains from the panels themselves. The hard truth of the matter is that most, if not all of the research to make a viable solar car needs to be done for the panels themselves; 27% efficiency is simply not enough for something that eats as much energy as it uses. Plus, the power generation research aspect of solar panels is maybe 1/5th of the team's engineering efforts. 

So if this isn't for the good of the world, for folks to _really_ end up in solar panel research, it's really more of an opportunity for young minds to learn the ropes of embedded systems and power systems, composite manufacturing, dynamics, etc. and to give people experience for entering an engineering field. It has definitely served that purpose for me.

My college experience is plagued with solar car work. It's been the only constant in my life for the past four years. But I've never _needed_ it; at least, not for career purposes. Plenty of people are able to get jobs from UT ECE if you're motivated enough; it's a pretty good school for that sort of thing. The value of it being on my resume as an eye-catcher ended my sophomore year (although it's still nice to talk about it in interviews). And oftentimes, folks are baffled that I'd want to work on "career stuff" outside of class.

I do it because it's fun. I do it because I'm interested in the field I'm in as a hobby. I love working with hardware and low-level programming. I feel the same way about my internships. All the traditional career success I've achieved is because I enjoy the work more than most, and I'm motivated to work more than many (and I also market myself well, but that's another story). And I feel confident about my success.

Many engineers do feel the same way as I do. I'm in a team full of them. Engineering and _problem-solving for the sake of problem-solving_ is an exciting endeavor. And if you don't feel that way, that's also completely fine, it's a lucrative and (mostly) stable career choice which leaves you enough time for leisure. But the point is that engineering is fun, and doing it for absolutely no reason is fun.

## Part 2: Engineering as a Career
What is engineering for? Well, it's using science and math to solve real-world problems. This could be anything from renewables to biomedical devices to architecture, to missiles to user data collection to AI art. Engineering is the cornerstone of a functioning society, and everything you see is engineered somewhat. But at the same time, the most lucrative engineering jobs are often the killers of society. Oftentimes these uses overshadow the benefit engineering can do, and social pressure and Indian parents can push one into these "killer" jobs.

So of course, if you care about the world and the people in it, and if you want to put your money where your mouth is, you'd need to work in a career that's benefitting society. Biomedical, nuclear reactors, solar power, waste management, designing products for the disabled are all good applications of engineering I'd say. At the very least, you should not work in defense, at a large unnamed social media company that profits off your data, or on negative uses of AI (honestly, at the point we're at, any AI at all).

Here are some excuses I've had the opportunity to listen to:
- _I need to provide for my family, and I value my own comfort and monetary status over society._
    - I don't necessarily see a world that exists in the next 40 years in the same state it does now (energy crisis and all). Your family is fucked unless you (and everyone else) does something about it.
- _If I'm not doing it, someone else will be. Might as well be me that makes the money._
    - I've heard similar arguments against voting. The fact is, evil is not built by just one poorly-intentioned individual, but tens of thousands of well-meaning individuals that make enough money to turn a blind eye.
- _You're just virtue signaling. Every job will have some negative consequence._
    - Yeah probably. I probably am virtue signaling a little bit. I admit that. But it's also the way I feel, at least enough to write a blog post about it. I'll address the nuance in a second, just bear with me.
- _I don't have any other offers at the moment. This is my only option._
    - If you're smart enough to get an offer at this lucrative position at Lockheed Martin, I think you're probably smart enough to get a job at ten other places that would probably have less negative impact.
- _At least I don't find joy in it. I do it begrudgingly!_
    - See bullet number two.

I'm being purposefully idealistic to try to get you to think about the career decisions you make. Of _course_ there's nuance here. Of _course_ you can't expect someone to make all the right decisions. Even jobs that seem societally beneficial ("I extract lithium from cobalt to power your TV remote!") can have evil rooted in it as a result of our colonialism and capitalism and the US and blah blah blah blah (see [Child Labor in Cobalt Mines](https://apnews.com/article/lithium-mining-energy-transition-child-labor-nigeria-africa-22155590dddf7ecc0b9fd55b221c6d9f)). Nothing is good and pure in this world, and everything is built on evil. 

Really all I expect you to do is _try_. Consider that one of the main ways you have agency is choosing where you spend the majority of the rest of your life. Consider that your job (like it or not) is considered "*what you do*", and your actions indicate, to some extent, who you are as a person. And consider that choosing to work in an industry that maybe doesn't make as much money but does something _you believe in_ is virtuous (also, if you're an engineer, you're likely still fine even if you don't make $300K you rich, high-horse motherfucker). There's no reason to do the right thing other than doing the right thing.
