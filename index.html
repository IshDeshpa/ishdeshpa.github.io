    <b>Hi!</b>

      <p>
      I am Ishan Deshpande, a masters' student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin. My passion lies in embedded software development and systems level work. I enjoy seeing the products I develop come to life in my hands. Currently, I am the next Chief Engineer on the UT Longhorn Racing Solar Team, where I work with the team on ARM-based embedded systems and a real-time operating system (RTOS) for controlling a solar-powered vehicle.

      My last summer internship at Meta Reality Labs involved developing support firmware and software for their internal research products for AR and VR. Before that, I was an intern at Tesla, where I had the opportunity to work on Body Controls Firmware for their Electronic Control Units on a wide array of vehicles. Previously, I was an intern at Garmin, pioneering advanced control systems for flight and navigation. In my free time, I like to listen to albums, play table tennis, and produce music.I am Ishan Deshpande, a student pursuing a integrated master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin.
