    <b>Hi!</b>
    <p>
      I am Ishan Deshpande, a senior pursuing a integrated master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin. My passion lies in embedded software development and operating systems development. I enjoy seeing the products I develop come to life in my hands. Currently, I am the Platform Lead on the UT Longhorn Racing Solar Team, where I work on ARM-based embedded systems and a real-time operating system (RTOS) for controlling a solar-powered vehicle.

      During my last summer internship at Tesla, I had the opportunity to work on Body Controls Firmware for their Electronic Control Units on a wide array of vehicles. Previously, I was an intern at Garmin, pioneering advanced control systems for flight and navigation. In my free time, I like to listen to albums, play table tennis, and produce music.
