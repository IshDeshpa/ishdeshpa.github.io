    <b>Hi!</b>
    <div id="about-me">
      <div id="about-desc">
	<p>
	I am Ishan Deshpande, a masters' student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin. My passion lies in embedded software development and systems level work. I enjoy seeing the products I develop come to life in my hands. Currently, I am the next Chief Engineer on the UT Longhorn Racing Solar Team, where I work with the team on ARM-based embedded systems and a real-time operating system (RTOS) for controlling a solar-powered vehicle.

	This summer, I'll be interning at Meta Reality Labs working on embedded development with their next-level research teams. During my last summer internship at Tesla, I had the opportunity to work on Body Controls Firmware for their Electronic Control Units on a wide array of vehicles. Previously, I was an intern at Garmin, pioneering advanced control systems for flight and navigation. In my free time, I like to listen to albums, play table tennis, and produce music.
